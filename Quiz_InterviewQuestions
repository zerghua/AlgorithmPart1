Week 1.1  Union−Find
----------------------------------------
1. Social network connectivity.
Given a social network containing n members and a log file containing m timestamps at which times pairs of members
formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected
(i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by
timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be mlogn
or better and use extra space proportional to n.

2. Union-find with specific canonical element.
Add a method find() to the union-find data type so that find(i) returns the largest element in the connected component
containing i. The operations, union(), connected(), and find() should all take logarithmic time or better.

For example, if one of the connected components is {1,2,6,9}, then the find() method should return 9 for each of the
four elements in the connected components.




3. Successor with delete.
Given a set of N integers S={0,1,...,n−1} and a sequence of requests of the following form:

    Remove x from S
    Find the successor of x: the smallest y in S such that y≥x.

design a data type so that all operations (except construction) take logarithmic time or better in the worst case.

2. Search in a bitonic array.
An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately by a decreasing
sequence of integers. Write a program that, given a bitonic array of n distinct integer values,
determines whether a given integer is in the array.

    Standard version: Use ∼3lgn compares in the worst case.
    Signing bonus: Use ∼2lgn compares in the worst case (and prove that no algorithm can
    guarantee to perform fewer than ∼2lgn compares in the worst case).

Suppose that you have an n-story building (with floors 1 through n) and plenty of eggs. An egg breaks if it is dropped
from floor T or higher and does not break otherwise. Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value
of T given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:

    Version 0: 1 egg, ≤T tosses.
    Version 1: ∼1lgn eggs and ∼1lgn tosses.
    Version 2: ∼lgT eggs and ∼2lgT tosses.

Given an array of n buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue pebble, sort them by color.

    color(i): color of pebble in bucket i.

The performance requirements are as follows:

    At most n calls to color().
    At most n calls to swap().
    Constant extra space.

Week 3.2 Quicksort
----------------------------------------
1. Nuts and bolts.
A disorganized carpenter has a mixed pile of n nuts and n bolts. The goal is to find the corresponding pairs of
nuts and bolts. Each nut fits exactly one bolt and each bolt fits exactly one nut. By fitting a nut and a bolt together,
the carpenter can see which one is bigger (but the carpenter cannot compare two nuts or two bolts directly).

Describe how to add the methods sample() and delRandom() to our binary heap implementation. The two methods return a key

method should take constant time; the delRandom() method should take logarithmic time.
Do not worry about resizing the underlying array.
