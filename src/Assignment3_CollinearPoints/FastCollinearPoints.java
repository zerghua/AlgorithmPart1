/**
 * Created by HuaZ on 2/9/2017.
 * <p/>
 * A faster, sorting-based solution. Remarkably,
 * it is possible to solve the problem much faster than the brute-force solution described above.
 * Given a point p, the following method determines whether p participates in a set of 4 or more
 * collinear points.
 * <p/>
 * 1. Think of p as the origin.
 * 2. For each other point q, determine the slope it makes with p.
 * 3. Sort the points according to the slopes they makes with p.
 * 4. Check if any 3 (or more) adjacent points in the sorted order have equal slopes with respect to p.
 * If so, these points, together with p, are collinear.
 * <p/>
 * Applying this method for each of the n points in turn yields an efficient algorithm to the problem.
 * The algorithm solves the problem because points that have equal slopes with respect to p are collinear,
 * and sorting brings such points together.
 * The algorithm is fast because the bottleneck operation is sorting.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The method segments() should include each maximal line segment containing 4 (or more) points exactly once.
 * For example, if 5 points appear on a line segment in the order p→q→r→s→t,
 * then do not include the subsegments p→s or q→t.
 * <p/>
 * Corner cases.
 * Throw a java.lang.NullPointerException
 * either the argument to the constructor is null or if any point in the array is null.
 * <p/>
 * Throw a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
 * if the argument to the constructor contains a repeated point.
 * <p/>
 * Performance requirement.
 * The order of growth of the running time of your program should be n2 log n in the worst case
 * and it should use space proportional to n plus the number of line segments returned.
 * Assignment3_CollinearPoints.FastCollinearPoints should work properly even if the input has 5 or more collinear points.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Notes:
 * bug fixed:
 * 1. should be sortedPoints[j-1] rather than sortedPoints[j] when found more than 3.
 * 2. sort needs to be stable in slopeOrder() comparator.
 * <p/>
