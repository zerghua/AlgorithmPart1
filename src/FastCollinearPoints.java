 A faster, sorting-based solution. Remarkably,
 it is possible to solve the problem much faster than the brute-force solution described above.
 Given a point p, the following method determines whether p participates in a set of 4 or more
 collinear points.

 1. Think of p as the origin.
 2. For each other point q, determine the slope it makes with p.
 3. Sort the points according to the slopes they makes with p.
 4. Check if any 3 (or more) adjacent points in the sorted order have equal slopes with respect to p.
 If so, these points, together with p, are collinear.

 Applying this method for each of the n points in turn yields an efficient algorithm to the problem.
 The algorithm solves the problem because points that have equal slopes with respect to p are collinear,
 and sorting brings such points together.
 The algorithm is fast because the bottleneck operation is sorting.


 The method segments() should include each maximal line segment containing 4 (or more) points exactly once.
 For example, if 5 points appear on a line segment in the order p→q→r→s→t,
 then do not include the subsegments p→s or q→t.

 Corner cases.
 Throw a java.lang.NullPointerException
 either the argument to the constructor is null or if any point in the array is null.

 Throw a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
 if the argument to the constructor contains a repeated point.

 Performance requirement.
 The order of growth of the running time of your program should be n2 log n in the worst case
 and it should use space proportional to n plus the number of line segments returned.
 FastCollinearPoints should work properly even if the input has 5 or more collinear points.


 Notes:
 bug fixed:
 1. should be sortedPoints[j-1] rather than sortedPoints[j] when found more than 3.
 2. sort needs to be stable in slopeOrder() comparator.
